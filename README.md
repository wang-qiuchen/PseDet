## ðŸš€Overview

- We revisit the strategy of pseudo-labeling on incremental object detection and identify three critical problems that hinder it from achieving competitive performance.
- Based on the above findings, we propose PseDet, a simple yet effective pseudo-labeling framework for incremental object detection, which consists of three key components: spatiotemporal enhancement module, categorical adaptive label selector, and confidence score calibration supervision. 
- Extensive experiments conducted on the MS COCO dataset with various incremental settings validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, PseDet outperforms previous methods by 4~17 mAP on different learning settings, achieving new state-of-the-art in incremental object detection.
